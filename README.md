                                         Introduction
The dataset used in this project contains information about Netflix's diverse collection of movies and TV shows. It includes key attributes such as the title, type (Movie or TV Show), release year, date added to Netflix, rating, country of origin, cast, director, and duration. The dataset also includes metadata about the genres the titles belong to, offering insights into content like children’s movies, stand-up comedy, and kids' TV shows.
                                          Objectives
* Analyze the distribution of Netflix content across different categories such as type (Movie or TV Show), release year, and ratings.
* Identify trends in Netflix content production, such as how the duration of movies varies or how the number of TV shows has evolved over time.
* Provide insights into how Netflix's content is distributed geographically.
* Identify any gaps or interesting patterns, such as underrepresented countries or genres.

                                           Task
Data Cleaning:
* Gather and preprocess the Netflix dataset, ensuring data quality and consistency.
* Ensuring the data is free from inconsistencies or missing values. For instance, ensuring that movies have valid durations and TV shows have valid season counts.
* we changed  the data type, replaced the value, removed the column

Data Import: 
* Loading the dataset into Power BI and structuring it for analysis.

Data Visualization:
* Drag and drop fields from the Fields pane onto the canvas to create visualizations.
* Create informative visualizations to communicate findings effectively and support decision-making.
* A pie chart to show the proportion of Movies vs. TV Shows.
* A map visualization to show the geographical distribution of content.
* stacked bar chart to analyze the calculated maximum and minimum Netflix rating.
* Treemap to analyze the distribution of the top 10 countries by genre.
* stacked area chart to show the count of titles (movies) by release year.
* An area chart to show the ratio of the count of categories by release year and genre

                                              Outcomes
* Identification of popular content genres, themes, and release years.
* A clear understanding of the ratio of Movies to TV Shows on Netflix. For example, we might find that Netflix offers more TV shows than movies, or vice versa.
* A visual representation of content production by country, showing which countries contribute the most content to Netflix’s platform. This can reveal Netflix's global strategy in acquiring or producing content from specific regions.
* Insights into how the number of releases has changed over time. For instance, we might observe that Netflix’s content library grew rapidly between 2015 and 2020 as the platform expanded its production.
* A deep understanding of Netflix subscribers' viewing preferences and demographics.
* A framework for ongoing data-driven decision-making in the entertainment industry.

                                             Challenges

* Data quality and completeness: 
Ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the Netflix dataset can be challenging, as it may contain missing values, inconsistencies, or biases.

* Dynamic nature of the entertainment industry:
The rapidly evolving landscape of the entertainment industry can make it difficult to capture long-term trends and anticipate future changes.

* Rating Variability:
The rating system across countries can vary, and while the dataset might provide a single rating per title, Netflix's content might have different ratings in different regions.

* Data Updates:
The dataset is static, but Netflix continuously adds or removes content. This means the dataset may quickly become outdated unless regularly refreshed, impacting the relevance of the insights.
